*   Program Overview:                                                     *
*       This program employs Snobol4, uses derived type to build the data *
*       structure of a linked list. There are four main functions for the *
*       project - insertion, update, deletion, and display. Information is*
*       inserted in order, so searching and display will be also in order *
*       The program reads the input file and do accordantly through       *
*       subroutines and derived type.                                     *
*                                                                         *
*                                                                         *
*   Input: File input provided from the instructor                        *
*                                                                         *
*   Output:                                                               *
*       Output from the program will consist of â€“                         *
*     1) appropriate user feedback indicating successful completion of    *
*     the commands (insert, delete, update, or print)                     *
*     2) upon termination of the input, a complete listing                *
*     of all nodes in the linked list starting with the first node        *
*                                                                         *
*                                                                         *
*   Significant Program Variables:                                        *
*       id                  - integer type, holds identification number   *
*                           of the person in the list                     *
*       department          - character type, holds the departmental/     *
*                             subject info of the educator                *
*       title               - character type, holds the title             *
*       pay                 - float type, holds the amount of payment     *
*       person              - derived type/object holds all the info      *
*                           and a link to the next person                 *
*       runner              - a pointer of the derived type, used for     *
*                           searching and getting information             *
